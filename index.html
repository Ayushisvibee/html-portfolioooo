<h3>Kabir Singh</h3>

<p>My genre in movies is kind of different . This is a romantic movie with a great story line</p>

<h3>The Wolf Of The Wall Street</h3>

<p>This Movie is perfect example of how a middle class boy can achieve a great succes if he works hard and smartly </p>

<h3>Fast and Furious (Tokyo drift)</h3>

<p>One of the best movies which shows how a teenager from outside the town rules the tokyo city by defeating the local gangster with lots of struggle</p>
